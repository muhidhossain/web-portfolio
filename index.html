            <h3>Professional Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I am a student of Geoloy. But the subject is not my type. Sometime I feel like I am westing money of our government. If a person who likes Geoloy was in my position, he/she could do a lots of progress. As I don't like Geology that's why I learned <strong>Web Development</strong> and you can hire me.</p>
